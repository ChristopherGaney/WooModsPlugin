# WooModsPlugin
Adds a tab in WooCommerce Settings for My Woo Mods where user can choose to enable or disable each modification that is defined in the plugin.

I basically took all of the actions and filters that I would normally add to functions.php and put them in a plugin. If you are comfortable editing functions.php, then you could probably add fields to this plugin.
